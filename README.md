The AI Chatbot Assistant is an interactive feature integrated into the Deadlock Detection System that helps users communicate with the application using simple text commands.

Instead of only clicking buttons, users can now:

Ask the system to check for deadlocks

Request graph visualization

Get explanations

Learn deadlock concepts

Receive guidance

The chatbot acts like a mini Operating System assistant inside the application.
